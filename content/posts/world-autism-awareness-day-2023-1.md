New Delhi: Today is the United Nations-sanctioned World Autism Awareness Day. Autism Awareness Day is observed annually on April 2 to raise awareness of autistic people all over the world. This day is observed to promote greater awareness of autism and acceptance of autistic people in all spheres of life, including the workplace.

April is Autism Awareness and Acceptance Month. People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their successes should be acknowledged every day, although April is traditionally the month to honour their accomplishments, tremendous abilities, and contributions to society. To reduce the stigma associated with autism, we should educate ourselves about how we can support those who have ASD and raise awareness of the issue.

**What is autism?**

With an early infancy onset, autism is a neurological disorder that impacts people for the rest of their lives without regard to race, social status, or gender. The phrase "autism spectrum" is used to describe a wide array of symptoms. Individuals on the spectrum have the right to fair treatment and may contribute fully to society with the right kind of help and understanding.

The needs and abilities of autistic people may evolve over time. WHO claims that some persons with autism may function normally in society, while others face such significant challenges that they will always need assistance.

**The bottom line**

Instead of making assumptions, adhering to stereotypes, or discounting the experiences of those with ASD, one must educate themselves about autism and raise awareness of the condition. We should all learn to be more supportive of those with ASD by being more patient and understanding with them and by making an effort to learn how to help them by researching and reading up on how to create a welcoming and safe environment for them.

**Vocabulary**

That means they have different strengths and challenges than people whose brains don't have those differences. The possible differences include medical disorders, learning disabilities, and other conditions.
