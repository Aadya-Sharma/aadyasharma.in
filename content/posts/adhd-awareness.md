New Delhi: Every October, events and activities worldwide, mostly online, are held to raise awareness of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These events and activities attract the attention of numerous national, regional, and local media outlets and result in articles, interviews, and feature stories.

ADHD is one of the most prevalent mental health conditions affecting both adults and children and is frequently misdiagnosed. By exposing the experiences of the ADHD community and educating people about the symptoms of ADHD.

***What is ADHD?***

*It is a behavioural disorder with three* primary characteristics; inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. ADHD can have a significant impact on a kid's relationships and academic performance. Their lives at home and school are also influenced by the same. Children with ADHD may struggle to focus, act impulsively (doing things, making decisions, or blurting things out aloud without thinking them through or contemplating the potential repercussions), or be overly active.

***Signs and Symptoms of ADHD in Children***

Although it is common for kids to have trouble focusing and behaving at times, children with ADHD do not outgrow these behaviours, and the symptoms can be very severe, which can cause problems at school, at home, or with friends.

According to CDC.gov, children with ADHD may: daydream frequently; squirm or fidget frequently, such as by finding it difficult to stay still for an extended amount of time or by fidgeting with objects; talk excessively and make careless mistakes.

***ADHD in Adults***

ADHD can last into adulthood. Some adults have ADHD but have never been diagnosed. The symptoms start in early childhood and continue into adulthood. In some cases, ADHD is not recognised or diagnosed until the person is an adult. ADHD symptoms in adults may not be as prominent as those in children.

Adults may experience fewer of the hyperactivity symptoms. But they could still experience issues with impulsivity, restlessness, and concentration. Many people don't even realise they have ADHD; all they are aware of is the possibility that daily activities may be challenging.

 Adults with ADHD may have difficulty focusing and setting priorities, which can lead to missed deadlines, postponed meetings, and ignored social engagements. According to mayoclinic.org, ADHD symptoms in adults may include impulsiveness, disorganization, problems prioritizing, poor time management skills, trouble multitasking, frequent mood swings, trouble coping with stress, etc.
