New Delhi: Stigma starts when people begin to identify differences, often based on stereotypes and prejudices, and start to link people to undesirable characteristics. Labelling creates a barrier. Hence, separating the stigmatised group—"them"—from "us". Therefore, this results in discrimination. Countless marginalised groups experience stigma, and many individuals face enhanced intersectional stigma because they belong to more than one marginalised group.

The stigma associated with autism can be detrimental to the well-being of people who have it. Poor physical and mental health as well as fewer social connections are examples of this. The stigma surrounding autism may encourage more "camouflaging" of autistic characteristics.

For instance, the complexities of being a young person with autism are respectfully and authentically explored in Netflix's Heartbreak High reboot. Quinni, a lesbian autistic girl in the series, concealed her autism to avoid the difficulties faced by young autistic women. When a neurodivergent person informs a neurotypical person that they are neurodivergent, it frequently happens that no one believes them, which causes them to feel compelled to hide their true selves.

A scene particularly reflective of this involves Quinni revealing to Sasha that she is autistic, and Sasha is visibly surprised, questioning how she didn't know this previously because "I’ve met autistic people" before. Quinni responds by saying she's "good at masking".

We've already seen in a brief on-screen interaction the stereotypes and presumptions that the general public frequently has about autistic people, as well as how women with autism feel pressured to hide their true selves.

Many television programmes and films have portrayed characters who have autism, but many of them have struggled to do it well because of stereotypes,  lack of research, or the casting of non-autistic persons.

People frequently assume that if a person doesn't exhibit the same autistic features as characters like Sheldon Cooper, then they aren't autistic. But that's not the case. While ASD is referred to as a spectrum because of the range of its signs and symptoms, as well as the various consequences and support needs that people may experience, no two autistic people have exactly the same combination of symptoms.

Poor media representation of neurodiversity feeds the pre-existing stigma surrounding the same and ends up causing harm. The purpose of media representation is to spread awareness, but by following stereotypes and casting neurotypicals, instead of spreading awareness about mental health disorders and neurodiversity, you end up invalidating their experiences and hurting them instead of making them feel heard or seen.

*Conclusion:* To ensure that neurodivergent people are accurately portrayed in films, more roles like Quinni—played by Chloé Hayden, an actress who is autistic and a disability rights activist—are needed. They should be played by neurodivergent performers to highlight the real-life experiences of neurodivergent people while showing the different symptoms experienced by different people instead of adhering to stereotypes.
